## Basic informations for the teacher

- Q2 to Q5 are currently in the same file
- The "_data" folder corresponds to random files we test commands on.
- There has been a bug since Q6 : If a command isn't recognized, the command buffer won't be entirely emptied, and it will only empty a single char
per command until it goes back to normal.
